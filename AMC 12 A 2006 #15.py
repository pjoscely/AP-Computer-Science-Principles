This program uses Monte Carlo Simulation to solve an American Math Competition Problem AMC
The problem is from the 2006 AMC 12A Problem 20

A bug starts at one vertex of a cube and moves along the edges of the cube 
according to the following rule. At each vertex the bug will choose to travel 
along one of the three edges emanating from that vertex. 
Each edge has equal probability of being chosen, 
and all choices are independent. What is the probability 
that after seven moves the bug will have visited every vertex exactly once?
